# AwesomeApp
My First Mobile Application using React-Native
If you want to run this app and debug into your target device run the following commands after you open this project in any preferred Code Editor or IDE.

1.) npx react-native upgrade (to regenerate the adnroid and ios files, which are necessary).

2.) npx react-native link (it's an automatic way for installing native dependencies, but sometimes this command is not enough so some manual steps may be needed where you can refer docs when certain error related to it pops up).

3.) then run npm install command to install node-modules since it's a javascript framework

4.)After success generation android and ios files and installing native dependencies, you can do the final command to run. npx react-native run-android (obviously for android). npx react-native run-ios (obviously for ios)

4.) Also please run this command npx react-native start too alonside.(I tell you to frist execute npx react-native start command first and then later execute npx react-native run-android or ios alongside either in two terminals or in side by side by side terminals in your Code Editor or in your IDE)
